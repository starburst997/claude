- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Keep README files up to date

## Critical Requirements

**ALL steps in this section are MANDATORY and must be completed in the same response as the triggering change. Use TodoWrite to track each step separately.**

## Name

### Documentation Updates

When documentation needs updating, you must:

1. Update README.md (tables, usage examples, relevant sections)
2. Update docs/index.html if it exists
3. Complete all updates BEFORE marking the task complete
4. Never defer documentation to follow-up tasks

### Triggers Requiring Documentation

- **GitHub Action inputs/outputs**: When modifying action.yml inputs or outputs, documentation updates are mandatory
- **Plugin features**: When adding/removing/updating plugins or plugin features (commands, agents, skills, hooks)
